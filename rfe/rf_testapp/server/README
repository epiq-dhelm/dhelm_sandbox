Utils (Utilities) Directory

This directory contains utility applications that are designed for debugging 
purposes.

The intent is to replace all of the old legacy test apps with new and 
improved test apps.  This directory will contain those replacements.

These can be built by calling make.  If you are on an x86_64 machine.  
If not you need to set the BUILD_CONFIG parameter to the platform you want 
to compile for.

$ BUILD_CONFIG=x86_32.gcc make

    aarch64.native
    aarch64.gcc6.3
    x86_64.gcc
    arm_cortex-a9.gcc5.2_glibc_openwrt
    arm_cortex-a9.gcc4.8_gnueabihf_linux
    arm_cortex-a9.gcc4.9.2_gnueabi
    arm_cortex-a9.gcc7.2.1_gnueabihf


This will create a bin directory that contains the BUILD_CONFG directory and 
then the binaries inside that directory.  This allows the ability to make the 
applications for different platforms and not have them automatically removed 
when compiling for a different one.


The src directory contains utils_common files that will handle the command 
line parameters and configure the radio for all of the applications in the 
directory.

The utils_common will ensure that the handling of command line parameters 
and configuration is consistent across all of the applications.  Plus this 
makes it simpler to make new applications and changing things in common 
command line parameters and configuration can be done in one place 
for all applications.
