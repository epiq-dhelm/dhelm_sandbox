This directory is used to do RF in the loop testing.

This provides the ability to issue commands from Bash scripts or Python code to perform the following:

StartCW: Send a continuous tone out to the "card under test"

StartSweep: Send a tone sweeping over a frequency range to the "card under test".

StopGen: Stop any tone's being sent.

PeakSearch: Receive a signal from a "card under test" and look over a frequency range and report the peak frequency and power back to the test script. 

The "TCP client" is called from the bash or python test code.  This establishes a TCP connection to the "TCP Server" which must exist on the host connected to the Sidekiq card used to generate or listen to the tones.  Lets call this the generator/analyzer card.

Client:
The code in the client directory is intended to show how to "call" the functions from Bash, in the "example apps" directory.  Or from python in the "libtest" file.

This works because in the util directory there is a testapp.py file that actually performs the "client" functions talking to the server.

Server:
The code in the server directory actually performs the requested commands on the "generator/analyzer" Sidekiq card.  This server app must be running before any Client commands are issued.
